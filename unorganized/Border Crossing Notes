San Ysidro and Otay Mesa are two separate U.S. Customs ports, although they are physically quite close (just six miles apart).  In the early 1990s, San Ysidro no longer processed truck crossings.  Instead, truck crossings were diverted to Otay Mesa.  U.S. Customs however, did not immediately publish data differentiating truck crossings at Otay Mesa from San Ysidro. From 1994 to 1997 crossings at Otay Mesa and San Ysidro were reported as a combined total.  Data elements have been reported separately since the beginning of 1997, but for the purpose of time series consistency, for freight crossings (trucks, truck containers loaded and unloaded, trains, rail containers loaded and unloaded, and train passengers) the port is characterized as San Ysidro/Otay Mesa.  Since 1997, passenger crossings (personal vehicles and their passengers, bus crossings and their passengers, and pedestrians) have been reported separately for Otay Mesa and San Ysidro.
